# Introduction

A **static website** leverages a one-off content generation process, which creates the entire website.

This content can include:

* HTML pages
* Graphics
* Stylesheets
* Scripts
* XML sitemaps
* RSS feeds
* … and more

This generated set of pages can then be deployed to just about anywhere.

---

# Why?

**Write once — deploy anywhere**

&gt; CDN, GitHub pages, Netlify, Raspbery Pi, `python -m http.server`, or your mobile

**It&#39;s efficient**

&gt; A page is much more often viewed than it is updated

**Super fast serving**

&gt; Important for SEO

**Secure**

&gt; No chance for a break-in as there&#39;s nothing to break

**Version-controlled**

&gt; Everything in your Git (or not)

---

# Sounds nice, but…

But wait… How about dynamic content?

* News
* Blog posts
* Tags, sections
* RSS feeds
* Forms

---

# Here&#39;s the deal:

In many cases, **no dynamic content is necessary**.

For the content produced by you, every page, classification term, RSS entry etc. is known upfront.

## And if it still is…

* Client-side JS code
* Forms: external services (formspree.io, Netlify)
* Serverless implementation (AWS Lambda et al.)
* Split into *static* and *dynamic* parts

# Hugo is…

* Static website generator written in Go
* Incredibly fast: **&lt; 1 ms** per page
* Utilising Go Templates
* Sophisticated: variables, loops, conditions, expressions, lists, maps etc.

Example of a Hugo template:

```hugo
&lt;ul&gt;
    {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;{{ .Permalink }}&#34;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    {{ end }}
&lt;/ul&gt;
```

* Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OS, *BSD)
* Content in Markdown, Mmark, Org-mode or HTML
* Auto-generated taxonomies (tags, sections etc.)
* SASS/SCSS compilation (*extended version* needed)
* Asset minification (HTML/JS/CSS)
* External data sources (YAML, TOML, CSV etc.)
